                        <p >Please be thoughtful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose Information through the Site, such as on message boards or in advertising or notices you post, that Information may be publicly viewable and can be collected and used by third parties without mpartial&rsquo;s knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.</p>

                        <span className={'sub-title'}>Automatically-Collected Information</span>

                        <p >mpartial and certain third parties that advertise or provide other services on the Site may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Site, such as when you use the Site or certain Site services or click on advertisements on the Site or within mpartial. For example, mpartial and its partners and service providers may collect and analyze information such as:</p>

                        <p >Your Internet Protocol address;</p>
                        <p >Your mobile device ID;</p>
                        <p >Your computer&rsquo;s or mobile device&rsquo;s operating system and version;</p>
                        <p >The name of the domain you used to access the Internet;</p>
                        <p >Information related to the ways in which you interact with the Site, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Site, the frequency of your use of the Site, error logs, and other similar information. This information is collected passively through the use of certain electronic technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, and similar technologies, and is further explained below. As described further below, mpartial may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>

                        <p >Browser Cookies: We and certain third party advertising partners may use &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; When you use the Site, the pages you see, along with something called a &ldquo;cookie,&rdquo; may be downloaded to your computer, mobile device, or tablet (collectively, &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo;). Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your Equipment. These cookies may be used: (a) to improve or enhance your experience using the Site; (b) to deliver content, including advertising, specific to your interests; and (c) for other purposes, such as security and administrative functions. For example, cookies are used to store your preferences for certain types of information so that you do not have to input those preferences every time you use the Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, though different browsers may address cookies differently. Your browser may enable you to set your Equipment to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, it may result in certain personalized services or other features not being provided to you when you use that Equipment.</p>

                        <p >Flash Cookies: We and certain mpartial advertisers may choose to use Flash cookies in advertisements available on or through the Site or in mpartial periodicals. Flash cookies, also called Flash Local Shared Objects, are used by the Adobe Flash Player to store user preferences. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. More information concerning flash cookies, including how to remove them from your computer or device is available at here.</p>

                        <p >Web Beacons, Pixels and Clear GIFs: We and our advertising partners may use web beacons, pixels and clear GIFs. These electronic technologies are transparent image files that, if used, allow us and our advertising partners to track Website usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed and whether and when you have opened an HTML email, how many times the email was forwarded and which links in the email were clicked. Unlike cookies, these technologies are not placed on your Equipment. We and our advertising partners use information collected through Web beacons, pixels, and clear GIFs to improve and enhance our Site and measure the effectiveness of these communications with you. These technologies may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the Site or advertisements made by our advertising partners.</p>

                        <p >Information from Third Parties: mpartial may obtain additional information about you from third parties such as marketers, partners, sponsors, researchers, and others.
