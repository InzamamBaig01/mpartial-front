// 16.3+ will not execute our will-update method;

// Add a flag to suppress these warnings for this special case.

// As a workaround, use cWM and cWRP to invoke the new static lifecycle.

// As a workaround, use cWU to invoke the new lifecycle.

// Because for <= 15.x versions this might be a "prevContext" object.

// Because get-snapshot might return a falsy value.

// Because they would work differently between older and newer (16.3+) versions of React.

// Binding "this" is important for shallow renderer support.

// Call this.constructor.gDSFP to support sub-classes.

// DCE check should happen before ReactDOM bundle executes so that

// DevTools can report bad minification during injection.

// DevTools shouldn't crash React, no matter what.

// Error if any of these lifecycles are present,

// If new component APIs are defined, "unsafe" lifecycles won't be called.

// It will pass a snapshot value to did-update though.

// Newer versions of React will ignore that lifecycle if gSBU exists.

// Newer versions of React will ignore these lifecycles if gDSFP exists.

// Older versions will require our polyfilled will-update value.

// React <= 16.2 does not support getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.

// React <= 16.2 does not support static getDerivedStateFromProps.

// React may warn about cWM/cWRP/cWU methods being deprecated.

// So check for the explicit __reactInternalSnapshotFlag flag to determine behavior.

// Use the setState() updater to ensure state isn't stale in certain edge cases.

// Verify that the code above has been dead code eliminated (DCE'd).

// We also can't just check "__reactInternalSnapshot",

// We need to handle both cases, but can't just check for the presence of "maybeSnapshot",

// We should still report in case we break this code.
