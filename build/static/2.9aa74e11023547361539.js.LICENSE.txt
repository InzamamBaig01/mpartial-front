     * <span class="informal">Use it when you have all these Observables, but still nothing is happening.</span>
     *
     * `subscribe` is not a regular operator, but a method that calls Observable's internal `subscribe` function. It
     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is
     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling
     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often
     * thought.
     *
     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values
     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two
     * following ways.
     *
     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods
     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create
     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do
     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also
     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't
     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will
     * be left uncaught.
     *
     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.
     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent
     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,
     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,
     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes
     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.
     *
     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.
     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean
     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback
     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.
     *
     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.
     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}
     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable
     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>
     * const sumObserver = {
     *   sum: 0,
     *   next(value) {
     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);
     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;
     *   },
     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,
     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.
     *   complete() {
     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);
     *   }

 *
 * <img src="./img/timeoutWith.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `timeoutWith` is a variation of `timeout` operator. It behaves exactly the same,
 * still accepting as a first argument either a number or a Date, which control - respectively -
 * when values of source Observable should be emitted or when it should complete.
 *
 * The only difference is that it accepts a second, required parameter. This parameter
 * should be an Observable which will be subscribed when source Observable fails any timeout check.
 * So whenever regular `timeout` would emit an error, `timeoutWith` will instead start re-emitting
 * values from second Observable. Note that this fallback Observable is not checked for timeouts
 * itself, so it can emit values and complete at arbitrary points in time. From the moment of a second
 * subscription, Observable returned from `timeoutWith` simply mirrors fallback stream. When that
 * stream completes, it completes as well.
 *
 * Scheduler, which in case of `timeout` is provided as as second argument, can be still provided
 * here - as a third, optional parameter. It still is used to schedule timeout checks and -
 * as a consequence - when second Observable will be subscribed, since subscription happens
 * immediately after failing check.
 *
 * @example <caption>Add fallback observable</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 * const minutes = Rx.Observable.interval(60 * 1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeoutWith(900, minutes)
 *     .subscribe(
 *         value => console.log(value), // After 900ms, will start emitting `minutes`,
 *                                      // since first value of `seconds` will not arrive fast enough.
 *         err => console.log(err) // Would be called after 900ms in case of `timeout`,

 *
 * <img src="./img/timeout.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `timeout` operator accepts as an argument either a number or a Date.
 *
 * If number was provided, it returns an Observable that behaves like a source
 * Observable, unless there is a period of time where there is no value emitted.
 * So if you provide `100` as argument and first value comes after 50ms from
 * the moment of subscription, this value will be simply re-emitted by the resulting
 * Observable. If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,
 * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.
 * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment
 * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be
 * emitted within specified period since previous value.
 *
 * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws
 * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between
 * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete
 * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting
 * stream behaves just as source Observable.
 *
 * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)
 * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.
 *
 * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,
 *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.
 * );
 *
 * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(

 *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.
 * );
 *
 * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);

/**
 *
 * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule
 * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over
 * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.
 *
 * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,
 * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal
 * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits
 * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.
 * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split
 * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source
 * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a
 * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.
 *
 * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications
 * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`
 * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error
 * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator
 * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used
 * for notification emissions in general.
 *
 * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>
 * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled
 *                                               // with async scheduler by default...

 *
 * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without
 * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will
 * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be
 * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,
 * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator
 * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out
 * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,
 * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.
 *
 * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete
 * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other
 * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be
 * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.
 *
 * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,
 * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after
 * the one that emitted error, never will.
 *
 * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values
 * will be "replayed" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable
 * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,
 * you can always use {@link repeat}.

 *
 * <img src="./img/onErrorResumeNext.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as
 * arguments or as an array. If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same
 * as the source.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.
 * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`
 * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting
 * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another
 * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will
 * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will
 * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive
 * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable
 * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with
 * an error.
 *
 * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not
 * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take
 * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Subscribe to the next Observable after map fails</caption>
 * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 0)
 *   .map(x => {
 *       if (x === 0) { throw Error(); }
